title: Bernstein’s Socks, Polynomial-Time Provable Coherence and Entanglement
abstract: We recently introduced a bounded rationality approach for the theory of
  desirable gambles. It is based on the unique requirement that being nonnegative
  for a gamble has to be defined so that it can be provable in polynomial time. In
  this paper we continue to investigate properties of this class of models. In particular
  we verify that the space of Bernstein polynomials in which nonnegativity is specified
  by the Krivine-Vasilescu certificate is yet another instance of this theory. As
  a consequence, we show how it is possible to construct in it a thought experiment
  uncovering entanglement with classical (hence non quantum) coins.
