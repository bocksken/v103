title: Credal Sentential Decision Diagrams
abstract: "<em>Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams</em> are logical circuits
  annotated by probability mass functions on the disjunctive gates. This allows for
  a compact representation of joint mass functions consistent with logical constraints.
  We propose a <em>credal</em> generalisation of the probabilistic quantification
  of these models, that allows to replace the local probabilities with (credal) sets
  of mass functions specified by linear constraints. This induces a joint credal set,
  that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the constraints.
  These models can support cautious estimates of the local parameters when only small
  amounts of training data are available. Algorithmic strategies to compute lower
  and upper bounds of marginal and conditional queries are provided. The task can
  be achieved in linear time with respect to the diagram size for marginal queries.
  The same can be done for conditional queries if the topology of the circuit is singly
  connected."
