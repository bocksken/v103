title: Imprecise Hypothesis-Based Bayesian Decision Making with Simple Hypotheses
abstract: 'Applied real-world decisions are frequently guided by the outcome of hypothesis-based
  statistical analyses. However, most often relevant information about the phenomenon
  of interest is available only imprecisely, and misleading results might be obtained,
  in particular, by either ignoring relevant information or pretending a level of
  knowledge that is not given. In order to be able to include (partial) information
  authentically in the imprecise form it is available, this paper tries to extend
  the framework of hypothesis-based Bayesian decision making with simple hypotheses
  to be able to deal with imprecise information about the three relevant quantities:
  hypotheses, prior beliefs, and loss function. Although straightforward at first
  glance, it appears that by specifying the hypotheses imprecisely, Bayesian updating
  of the prior beliefs might be inconsistent. In that, this paper provides the basic
  mathematical formulation to further extend imprecise hypothesis-based Bayesian decision
  theory to more elaborate contexts, such as those involving composite imprecise hypotheses,
  and in addition highlights the necessity of paying particular attention to the depicted
  updating issues.'
