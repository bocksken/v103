title: Hitting Times and Probabilities for Imprecise Markov Chains
abstract: 'We consider the problem of characterising expected hitting times and hitting
  probabilities for imprecise Markov chains. To this end, we consider three distinct
  ways in which imprecise Markov chains have been defined in the literature: as sets
  of homogeneous Markov chains, as sets of more general stochastic processes, and
  as game-theoretic probability models. Our first contribution is that all these different
  types of imprecise Markov chains have the same lower and upper expected hitting
  times, and similarly the hitting probabilities are the same for these three types.
  Moreover, we provide a characterisation of these quantities that directly generalises
  a similar characterisation for precise, homogeneous Markov chains.'
