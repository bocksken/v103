title: Improving the Convergence of Iterative Importance Sampling for Computing Upper
  and Lower Expectations
abstract: The aim of this paper is to present methods for improving the convergence
  of an iterative importance sampling algorithm for calculating lower and upper expectations
  with respect to sets of probability distributions. Our focus here is on the reuse
  and the combination of results obtained in previous iteration steps of the algorithm.
