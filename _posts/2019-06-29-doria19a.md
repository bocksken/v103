title: Coherent Upper Conditional Previsions Defined by Hausdorff Outer Measures for  Unbounded
  Random Variables
abstract: A model of upper conditional previsions for bounded and unbounded random
  variables with finite Choquet integral with respect to the Hausdorff outer and inner
  measures is proposed in a metric space. They are defined by the Choquet integral
  with respect to Hausdorff outer measures if the conditioning event has positive
  and finite Hausdorff outer measure in its dimension, otherwise, when the conditioning
  event has Hausdorff outer measure equal to zero or infinity in its Hausdorff dimension,
  they are defined by a 0-1 valued finitely, but not countably, additive probability.
