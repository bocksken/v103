title: Natural Selection with Objective Imprecise Probability
abstract: I argue that natural selection sometimes depends on objective imprecise
  probabilities. I give a general argument for the existence of objective imprecise
  probabilities. I then argue that natural selection, whether involving objective
  imprecise probabilities or not, would give rise to organisms whose behavior was
  imprecisely probabilistic, and that this would mean that other organismsâ€™ environments
  were imprecisely probabilistic. Since natural selection can be influenced by the
  environment, it therefore sometimes depends on objective imprecise probability.
  I explain why the absence of reports of objective imprecise probability in evolution
  is nevertheless unsurprising, and provide illustrations of ways to model natural
  selection with objective imprecise probabilities.
