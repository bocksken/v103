title: Aggregating Belief Models
abstract: 'This paper has two goals. The first goal is to say something about how
  one might combine different agents’ imprecise probabilities to generate an aggregate
  imprecise probability. The second goal is to champion the very general theory of
  “belief models” (de Cooman “Belief models: an order theoretic investigation” Annals
  of Mathematics and AI 2005) which, I think, deserves more attention. The belief
  models framework is interesting partly because many other formal models of reasoning
  appear as special cases of belief models (for example, propositional logic, ranking
  functions, imprecise probability).'
