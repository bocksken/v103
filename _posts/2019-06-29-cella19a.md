title: Incorporating Expert Opinion in an Inferential Model while Maintaining Validity
abstract: 'The incorporation of partial prior information in statistical inference
  problems still lacks a definitive answer. The two most popular statistical schools
  of thought deal with partial priors in different ways: they either get completely
  ignored (frequentist approach) or they are transformed into a “complete” prior information,
  i.e., a probability distribution (Bayesian approach). Acknowledging the importance
  of (i) taking into account all sources of relevant information in a given problem
  and (ii) controlling error probabilities, the present paper provides insights on
  how to incorporate partial priors “as they are”. This incorporation is guided by
  desired properties, such as that correct partial priors should result in more efficient
  inferences and, most importantly, that the inferences are always calibrated, independent
  of the truthfulness of the partial prior.'
