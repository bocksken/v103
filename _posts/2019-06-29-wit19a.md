title: Robustness in Sum-Product Networks with Continuous and Categorical Data
abstract: Sum-product networks are a popular family of probabilistic graphical models
  for which marginal inference can be performed in polynomial time. After learning
  sum-product networks from scarce data, small variations of parameters could lead
  to different conclusions. We adapt the robustness measure created for categorical
  credal sum-product networks to domains with both continuous and categorical variables.
  We apply this approach to a real-world dataset of online purchases where the goal
  is to identify fraudulent cases. We empirically show that such credal models can
  better discriminate between easy and hard instances than simply using the probability
  of the most probable class.
