title: 'Imprecise Compositional Data Analysis: Alternative Statistical Methods'
abstract: 'This paper briefly describes statistical methods for analyzing imprecise
  compositional data that might be elicited from approximate measurement or from expert
  judgments. Two alternative approaches are discussed: Log-ratio transforms and probability-ratio
  transforms. The first is well-established and the second is under development by
  the author. The primary focus in this paper is on generalized linear models for
  predicting imprecise compositional data.'
