title: Imprecise Probabilities as a Semantics for Intuitive Probabilistic Reasoning
abstract: I prove a connection between the logical framework for intuitive probabilistic
  reasoning (IPR) introduced by Crane (2017) and sets of probabilities. More specifically,
  this connection provides a straightforward interpretation of imprecise probabilities
  as subjective credal states, giving a formal semantics for Craneâ€™s IPR proposal.
