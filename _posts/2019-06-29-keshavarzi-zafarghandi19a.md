title: Embedding Probabilities, Utilities and Decisions in a Generalization of Abstract
  Dialectical Frameworks
abstract: Life is made up of a long list of decisions. In each of them there exists
  quite a number of choices and most of the decisions are effected by uncertainties
  and preferences, from choosing a healthy lunch and nice clothes to choosing a profession
  and a field of study. Uncertainties can be modeled by probabilities and preferences
  by utilities. A rational decision maker prefers to make a decision with the least
  regret or the most satisfaction. The principle of maximum expected utility can be
  helpful in this issue. Expected utility deals with problems in which agents make
  a decision under conditions in which probabilities of states play a role in the
  choice, as well as the utilities of outcomes. Argumentation formalisms could be
  an option to model these problems and to pick one or several alternatives. In this
  paper, a new argument-based framework, numerical abstract dialectical frameworks
  (nADFs for short), is introduced to do so. First, the semantics of this formalism,
  which is a generalization of abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs for short), based
  on many-valued interpretations are introduced, including preferred, grounded, complete
  and model-based semantics. Second, it is shown how nADFs are expressive enough to
  formalize standard decision problems. It is shown that the different types of semantics
  of an nADF that is associated with a decision problem all coincide and have the
  standard meaning. In this way, it is shown how the nADF semantics can be used to
  choose the best set of decisions.
