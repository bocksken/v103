title: Possibility Measures for Valid Statistical Inference Based on Censored Data
abstract: Inferential challenges that arise when data are corrupted by censoring have
  been extensively studied under the classical frameworks. In this paper, we provide
  an alternative approach based on a generalized inferential model whose output is
  a data-dependent possibility distribution. This construction is driven by an association
  between the censored data, parameter of interest, and unobserved auxiliary variable
  that takes the form of a relative likelihood. The possibility distribution then
  emerges from the introduction of a nested random set designed to predict that unobserved
  auxiliary variable and is calibrated to achieve certain frequentist guarantees.
  The performance of the proposed method is investigated using real and simulated
  data.
