title: Confidence in Belief, Weight of Evidence and Uncertainty Reporting
abstract: 'One way of putting a popular objection to the Bayesian account of belief
  and decision is that it does not allow a role for something akin to the Keynesian
  concept of ‘weight of evidence’ in choice. This paper argues that a recently-defended
  approach, which refines the credal-set representation of beliefs to give pride of
  place to an agent’s confidence in her beliefs, can do so fruitfully. Motivated by
  the use of confidence by the IPCC and US Defense Intelligence Agency in their assessments
  of uncertainty, the paper then considers the consequences of the proposed approach
  for uncertainty reporting. On the one hand, when connected to decision, the model
  affords a clear separation of the belief and value factors: an important quality
  in policy making contexts where these are the responsibility of different actors.
  On the other hand, the issue of inter-agent confidence calibration is discussed,
  and a calibration scale is proposed and defended, on the basis of weight-of-evidence
  version of David Lewis’s Principal Principle.'
