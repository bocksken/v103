title: Irrelevant Natural Extension for Choice Functions
abstract: 'We consider coherent choice functions under the recent axiomatisation proposed
  by De Bock and De Cooman that guarantees a representation in terms of binary preferences,
  and we discuss how to define conditioning in this framework. In a multivariate context,
  we propose a notion of marginalisation, and its inverse operation called weak (cylindrical)
  extension. We combine this with our definition of conditioning to define a notion
  of irrelevance, and we obtain the irrelevant natural extension in this framework:
  the least informative choice function that satisfies a given irrelevance assessment.'
