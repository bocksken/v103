title: Constructing Simulation Data with Dependency Structure for Unreliable Single-Cell
  RNA-Sequencing Data Using Copulas
abstract: Simulation studies are becoming increasingly important for the evaluation
  of complex statistical methods. They tend to represent idealized situations. With
  our framework, which incorporates dependency structures using copulas, we propose
  multidimensional simulation data with marginals based on different degrees of heterogeneity,
  which are built on different ranges of distribution parameters of a zero-inflated
  negative binomial distribution. The obtained higher and lower variation of the simulation
  data allows to create lower and upper distribution functions lead to simulation
  data containing extreme points for each observation. Our approach aims at being
  closer to reality by considering data distortion. It is an approach of examining
  classification quality in case of measurement distortions in gene expression data
  and might propose specific instructions of calibrating measuring instruments.
