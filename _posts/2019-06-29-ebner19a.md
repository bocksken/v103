title: Robust Bayes Factor for Independent Two-Sample Comparisons under Imprecise
  Prior Information
abstract: This paper proposes the robust Bayes Factor as a direct generalization of
  the conventional Bayes Factor for a special case of independent two-sample comparisons.
  Such comparisons are of great importance in psychological research, and more generally
  wherever the scientific endeavour is to ascertain a potential group effect. The
  conventional Bayes Factor as the ratio of the marginal likelihoods under two considered
  hypotheses demands for a precise, subjective specification of the prior distribution
  for the parameter of interest. Thus, it lacks the possibility of incorporating prior
  knowledge that is only available partially. Drawing on the theory of Imprecise Probabilities,
  the <em>robust</em> Bayes Factor is presented in view of lifting the restrictions
  on the specification of the prior distribution as being precise. In practice, the
  robust Bayes Factor approach enables an analyst to specify hyperparameter <em>intervals</em>,
  whose lengths correspond to the degree of subjective prior uncertainty. Based thereon,
  a set of (infinitely) many subjective prior distributions is established to substitute
  one precise prior distribution. Finally, the robust Bayes Factor is defined as an
  interval, bounded by the minimal and the maximal resultant Bayes Factor values.
  Latter are obtained by optimizing the conventional Bayes Factor over the predefined
  set of prior distributions. This explicit incorporation of incomplete prior knowledge
  increases the feasibility of applying a Bayesian approach to hypothesis comparisons
  in scientific practice. It reduces error-proneness, enables for an inclusion of
  multiple perspectives and encourages cautious, more realistic conclusions in hypothesis
  comparisons.
