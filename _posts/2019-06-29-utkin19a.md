title: Imprecise Extensions of Random Forests and Random Survival Forests
abstract: Robust weighted aggregation schemes taking into account imprecision of the
  decision tree estimates in random forests and in random survival forests are proposed
  in the paper. The first scheme dealing with the random forest improves the classification
  problem solution. The second scheme dealing with the random survival forest improves
  the survival analysis task solution. The main idea underlying the proposed modifications
  is to introduce the tree weights which take simultaneously into account imprecision
  of estimations as well as aims of the classification and regression problems. The
  imprecision of the tree estimates is defined by means of imprecise statistical inference
  models and interval models. Special modifications of loss functions for the classification
  and regression tasks are proposed in order to simplify minimax and maximin optimization
  problems for computing optimal weights. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed
  robust models.
