title: Interpreting, Axiomatising and Representing Coherent Choice Functions in Terms
  of Desirability
abstract: Choice functions constitute a simple, direct and very general mathematical
  framework for modelling choice under uncertainty. In particular, they are able to
  represent the set-valued choices that appear in imprecise-probabilistic decision
  making. We provide these choice functions with a clear interpretation in terms of
  desirability, use this interpretation to derive a set of basic coherence axioms,
  and show that this notion of coherence leads to a representation in terms of sets
  of strict preference orders. By imposing additional properties such as totality,
  the mixing property and Archimedeanity, we obtain representation in terms of sets
  of strict total orders, lexicographic probability systems, coherent lower previsions
  or linear previsions.
