title: 'Decideit 3.0: Software for Second-Order Based Decision Evaluations'
abstract: In this paper, we discuss representation and evaluation in the DecideIT
  3.0 decision tool which is based on a belief mass interpretation of the background
  information. The decision components are imprecise in terms of intervals and qualitative
  estimates and we emphasise how multiplicative and additive aggregations influence
  the resulting belief distribution over the expected values.
