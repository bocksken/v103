title: Robust Analysis of MAP Inference in Selective Sum-Product Networks
abstract: Sum-Product Networks (SPN) are deep probabilistic models that have shown
  to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several machine learning tasks. As with
  many other probabilistic models, performing Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) inference
  is NP-hard in SPNs. A notable exception is selective SPNs, that constrain the network
  so as to allow MAP inference to be performed in linear time. Due to the high number
  of parameters, SPNs learned from data can produce unreliable and overconfident inference;
  this phenomenon can be partially mitigated by performing a Robustness Analysis of
  the model predictions to changes in the parameters. In this work, we address the
  problem of assessing the robustness of MAP inferences produced with Selective SPNs
  to global perturbations of the parameters. We present efficient algorithms and an
  empirical analysis with realistic problems.
