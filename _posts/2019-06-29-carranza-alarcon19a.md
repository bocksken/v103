title: Imprecise Gaussian Discriminant Classification
abstract: Gaussian discriminant analysis is a popular classification model, that in
  the precise case can produce unreliable predictions in case of high uncertainty.
  While imprecise probability theory offer a nice theoretical framework to solve this
  issue, it has not been yet applied to Gaussian discriminant analysis. This work
  remedies this, by proposing a new Gaussian discriminant analysis based on robust
  Bayesian analysis and near-ignorance priors. The model delivers <em>cautious</em>
  predictions, in form of set-valued class, in case of limited or imperfect available
  information. Experiments show that including an imprecise component in the Gaussian
  discriminant analysis produces reasonably cautious predictions, in the sense that
  the number of set-valued predictions is not too high, and that those predictions
  correspond to hard-to-classify instances, that is instances for which the precise
  classifier accuracy drops.
