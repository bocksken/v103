title: SIPTA-Community Based on Paper Contributions – Descriptive Statistics and Network
  Analysis
abstract: The ISIPTA electronic proceedings provide an insight into the SIPTA community.
  For the anniversary edition of ISIPTA they are analyzed descriptively and in terms
  of a collaboration network. Different aspects, including paper keywords and geographic
  location are also investigated. A descriptive analysis of papers reveals how the
  type of papers changed over the years, including the hot topics by means of an analysis
  of the keywords of the papers. The network analyses show that there is a core of
  authors, contributing to ISIPTAs since the beginning, who are now key figures within
  the collaboration network, attracting new researchers who become key figures themselves.
