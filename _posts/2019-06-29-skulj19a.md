title: Extensions of Sets of Markov Operators Under Epistemic Irrelevance
abstract: Sets of Markov operators can serve as generalised models for imprecise probabilities.
  They act on gambles as transformations preserving desirability. Often imprecise
  probabilistic models and also sets of operators need to be extended to larger domains.
  Such extensions are especially interesting when some kind of independence requirements
  have to be taken into account. The goal of this paper is to propose extension methods
  for sets of Markov operators that are consistent with the existing extension methods
  for imprecise probabilistic models. The main focus is on extensions satisfying epistemic
  irrelevance. We propose a new general approach to extending sets of desirable gambles,
  called <em>additive independent extension</em>, which subsumes important types of
  extensions, such as epistemic irrelevance and marginal extension. This approach
  is then extended to sets of Markov operators, so that the extensions are consistent
  with those of sets of desirable gambles.
