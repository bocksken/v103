title: Extending Nearly-Linear Models
abstract: Nearly-Linear Models are a family of neighbourhood models, obtaining lower/upper
  probabilities from a given probability by a linear affine transformation with barriers.
  They include a number of known models as special cases, among them the Pari-Mutuel
  Model, the $\varepsilon$-contamination model, the Total Variation Model and the
  vacuous lower/upper probabilities. We classified Nearly-Linear models, investigating
  their consistency properties, in previous work. Here we focus on how to extend those
  Nearly-Linear Models that are coherent or at least avoid sure loss. We derive formulae
  for their natural extensions, interpret a specific model as a natural extension
  itself of a certain class of lower probabilities, and supply a risk measurement
  interpretation for one of the natural extensions we compute.
