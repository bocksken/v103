title: Graphoid Properties of Variants of Epistemic Independence Based on Regular
  Conditioning
abstract: Graphoid properties attempt to capture the most important features of abstract
  “independence”. We examine which semi-graphoid properties are satisfied by various
  concepts of independence for credal sets; we focus on variants of epistemic, confirmational,
  and type-5 independence that are based on regular conditioning.
