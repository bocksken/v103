title: Two-State Imprecise Markov Chains for Statistical Modelling of Two-State Non-Markovian
  Processes
abstract: This paper proposes a method for fitting a two-state imprecise Markov chain
  to time series data from a two-state non-Markovian process. Such non-Markovian processes
  are common in practical applications. We focus on how to fit modelling parameters
  based on data from a process where time to transition is not exponentially distributed,
  thereby violating the Markov assumption. We do so by first fitting a many-state
  (i.e. having more than two states) Markov chain to the data, through its associated
  phase-type distribution. Then, we lump the process to a two-state imprecise Markov
  chain. In practical applications, a two-state imprecise Markov chain might be more
  convenient than a many-state Markov chain, as we have closed analytic expressions
  for typical quantities of interest (including the lower and upper expectation of
  any function of the state at any point in time). A numerical example demonstrates
  how the entire inference process (fitting and prediction) can be done using Markov
  chain Monte Carlo, for a given set of prior distributions on the parameters. In
  particular, we numerically identify the set of posterior densities and posterior
  lower and upper expectations on all model parameters and predictive quantities.
  We compare our inferences under a range of sample sizes and model assumptions.
