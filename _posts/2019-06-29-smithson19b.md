title: 'Incompletely Known Sample Spaces: Models and Human Intuitions'
abstract: This paper surveys models and human intuitions about incompletely known
  “sample spaces” ($\Omega$). Given that there are very few guidelines for how best
  to form such beliefs when $\Omega$ is incompletely known, and there is very little
  research on the psychology behind beliefs about $\Omega$, this survey is preliminary
  and brings in ideas and models from probability and statistics, biology, and psychology.
  Pilot experimental studies of how people estimate the cardinality of $\Omega$ when
  given sample information from it are presented, demonstrating that to a surprising
  extent their estimates correspond with those produced by normative statistical models.
  The paper concludes by outlining future directions for a research program on this
  topic.
