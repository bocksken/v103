title: Random Set Solutions to Stochastic Wave Equations
abstract: This paper is devoted to three topics. First, to prove a measurability theorem
  for multifunctions with values in non-metrizable spaces, which is required to show
  that solutions to stochastic wave equations with interval parameters are random
  sets; second, to apply the theorem to wave equations in any space dimension; and
  third, to compute upper and lower probabilities of the values of the solution in
  the case of one space dimension.
keywords: random sets, fundamental measurability theorem, non-metrizable spaces, stochastic
  wave equations
