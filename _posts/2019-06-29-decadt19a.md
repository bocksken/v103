title: 'Monte Carlo Estimation for Imprecise Probabilities: Basic Properties'
abstract: We describe Monte Carlo methods for estimating lower envelopes of expectations
  of real random variables. We prove that the estimation bias is negative and that
  its absolute value shrinks with increasing sample size. We discuss fairly practical
  techniques for proving strong consistency of the estimators and use these to prove
  the consistency of an example in the literature. We also provide an example where
  there is no consistency.
