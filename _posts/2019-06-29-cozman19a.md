title: The Joy of Probabilistic Answer Set Programming
abstract: Probabilistic answer set programming (PASP) combines rules, facts, and independent
  probabilistic facts. Often one restricts such programs so that every query yields
  a sharp probability value. The purpose of this paper is to argue that a very useful
  modeling language is obtained by adopting a particular credal semantics for PASP,
  where one associates with each consistent program a credal set. We examine the basic
  properties of PASP and present an algorithm to compute (upper) probabilities given
  a program.
