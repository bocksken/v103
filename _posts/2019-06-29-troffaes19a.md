title: A Cantelli-Type Inequality for Constructing Non-Parametric P-Boxes Based on
  Exchangeability
abstract: In this paper we prove a new probability inequality that can be used to
  construct p-boxes in a non-parametric fashion, using the sample mean and sample
  standard deviation instead of the true mean and true standard deviation. The inequality
  relies only on exchangeability and boundedness.
