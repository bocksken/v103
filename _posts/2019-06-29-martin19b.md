title: On Valid Uncertainty Quantification About a Model
abstract: Inference on parameters within a given model is familiar, as is ranking
  different models for the purpose of selection. Less familiar, however, is the quantification
  of uncertainty about the models themselves. A Bayesian approach provides a posterior
  distribution for the model but it comes with no validity guarantees, and, therefore,
  is only suited for ranking and selection. In this paper, I will present an alternative
  way to view this model uncertainty problem, through the lens of a valid inferential
  model based on random sets and non-additive beliefs. Specifically, I will show that
  valid uncertainty quantification about a model is attainable within this framework
  in general, and highlight the benefits in a classical signal detection problem.
