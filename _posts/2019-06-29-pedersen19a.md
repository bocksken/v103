title: Dilation and Asymmetric Relevance
abstract: A characterization result of dilation in terms of positive and negative
  association admits an extremal counterexample, which we present together with a
  minor repair of the result. Dilation may be asymmetric whereas covariation itself
  is symmetric. Dilation is still characterized in terms of positive and negative
  covariation, however, once the event to be dilated has been specified.
