title: First Steps Towards an Imprecise Poisson Process
abstract: The Poisson process is the most elementary continuous-time stochastic process
  that models a stream of repeating events. It is uniquely characterised by a single
  parameter called the rate. Instead of a single value for this rate, we here consider
  a rate interval and let it characterise two nested sets of stochastic processes.
  We call these two sets of stochastic process imprecise Poisson processes, explain
  why this is justified, and study the corresponding lower and upper (conditional)
  expectations. Besides a general theoretical framework, we also provide practical
  methods to compute lower and upper (conditional) expectations of functions that
  depend on the number of events at a single point in time.
