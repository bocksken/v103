title: Simultaneous Inference under the Vacuous Orientation Assumption
abstract: I propose a novel approach to simultaneous inference that alleviates the
  need to specify a correlational structure among marginal errors. The <em>vacuous
  orientation</em> assumption retains what the normal i.i.d. assumption implies about
  the distribution of error configuration, but relaxes the implication that the error
  orientation is isotropic. When a large number of highly dependent hypotheses are
  tested simultaneously, the proposed model produces calibrated posterior inference
  by leveraging the logical relationship among them. This stands in contrast to the
  conservative performance of the Bonferroni correction, even if neither approaches
  makes assumptions about error dependence. The proposed model employs the Dempster-Shafer
  Extended Calculus of Probability, and delivers posterior inference in the form of
  stochastic three-valued logic.
