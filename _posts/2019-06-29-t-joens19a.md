title: In Search of a Global Belief Model for Discrete-Time Uncertain Processes
abstract: 'To model discrete-time uncertain processes, we argue for the use of a global
  belief model in the form of an upper expectation that satisfies a number of simple
  and intuitive axioms. We motivate these axioms on the basis of two possible interpretations
  for this upper expectation: a behavioural interpretation similar to that of Walley’s,
  and an interpretation in terms of upper envelopes of linear expectations. Subsequently,
  we show that the most conservative upper expectation satisfying our axioms coincides
  with a particular version of the game-theoretic upper expectation introduced by
  Shafer and Vovk. This has two important implications. On the one hand, it guarantees
  that there is a unique most conservative global belief model satisfying our axioms.
  On the other hand, it shows that Shafer and Vovk’s model can be given an axiomatic
  characterisation, thereby providing an alternative motivation for adopting this
  model, even outside their framework.'
