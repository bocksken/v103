title: A Short Note on the Equivalence of the Ontic and the Epistemic View on Data
  Imprecision for the Case of Stochastic Dominance for Interval-Valued Data
abstract: In the context of the analysis of interval-valued or set-valued data it
  is often emphasized that one has to carefully distinguish between an epistemic and
  an ontic understanding of set-valued data. However, there are cases, for which an
  ontic and an epistemic view do still lead to exactly the same results of the corresponding
  data analysis. The present paper is a short note on this fact in the context of
  the analysis of stochastic dominance for interval-valued data.
