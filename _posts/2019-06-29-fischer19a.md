title: On the Usefulness of Imprecise Bayesianism in Chemical Kinetics
abstract: Bayesian methods are growing ever more popular in chemical kinetics. The
  reasons for this and general challenges related to kinetic parameter estimation
  are shortly reviewed. Most authors content themselves with using one single (mostly
  uniform) prior distribution. The goal of this paper is to go into some serious issues
  this raises. The problems of confusing knowledge and ignorance and of reparametrisation
  are examined. The legitimacy of a probabilistic Ockhamâ€™s razor is called into question.
  A synthetic example involving two reaction models was used to illustrate how merging
  the parameter space volume with the model accuracy into a single number might be
  unwise. Robust Bayesian analysis appears to be a simple and straightforward way
  to avoid the problems mentioned throughout this article.
