title: Validity-Preservation Properties of Rules for Combining Inferential Models
abstract: An inferential model encodes the data analystâ€™s degrees of belief about
  an unknown quantity of interest based on the observed data, posited statistical
  model, etc. Inferences drawn based on these degrees of belief should be reliable
  in a certain sense, so we require the inferential model to be <em>valid</em>. The
  construction of valid inferential models based on individual pieces of data is relatively
  straightforward, but how to combine these so that the validity property is preserved?
  In this paper we analyze some common combination rules with respect to this question,
  and we conclude that the best strategy currently available is one that combines
  via a certain dimension reduction step before the inferential model construction.
