title: 'IP Scoring Rules: Foundations and Applications'
abstract: 'The mathematical foundations of imprecise probability theory (IP) have
  been in place for 25 years, and IP has proved successful in practice. But IP methods
  lack rigorous accuracy-centered, philosophical justifications. Traditional Bayesian
  methods can be justified using epistemic scoring rules, which measure the accuracy
  of the estimates that they produce. But there has been little work extending these
  justifications to the IP framework. This paper makes plea for the IP community to
  embrace this research programme. The plea comes in three parts. Firstly, I outline
  some initial work developing scoring rules for imprecise probabilities — IP scoring
  rules — and using them to shore up the philosophical foundations of IP. Secondly,
  I explain why a range of impossibility results for IP scoring rules should <em>not</em>
  dissuade the IP community from working on the foundations of IP scoring rules. Finally,
  I highlight one potential applications for IP scoring rules: IP aggregation.'
