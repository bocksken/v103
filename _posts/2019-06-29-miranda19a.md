title: A Unifying Frame for Neighbourhood and Distortion Models
abstract: 'Neighbourhoods of precise probabilities are instrumental to perform robustness
  analysis, as they rely on very few parameters. Many such models, sometimes referred
  to as <em>distortion</em> models, have been proposed in the literature, such as
  the pari-mutuel model, linear vacuous mixtures or the constant odds ratio model.
  In this paper, we show that all of them can be represented as probability sets that
  are neighbourhoods defined over different (pre)-metrics, providing a unified view
  of such models. We also compare them in terms of a number of properties: precision,
  number of extreme points, n-monotonicity, … thus providing possible guidelines to
  pick a neighbourhood rather than another.'
