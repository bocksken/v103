title: An Axiomatic Utility Theory for Dempster-Shafer Belief Functions
abstract: The main goal of this paper is to describe an axiomatic utility theory for
  Dempster-Shafer belief function lotteries. The axiomatic framework used is analogous
  to von Neumann-Morgenstern’s utility theory for probabilistic lotteries as described
  by Luce and Raiffa. Unlike the probabilistic case, our axiomatic framework leads
  to interval-valued utilities, and therefore, to a partial (incomplete) preference
  order on the set of all belief function lotteries. If the belief function reference
  lotteries we use are Bayesian belief functions, then our representation theorem
  coincides with Jaffray’s representation theorem for his linear utility theory for
  belief functions. We illustrate our framework using some examples discussed in the
  literature. Finally, we compare our decision theory with those proposed by Jaffray
  and Smets.
